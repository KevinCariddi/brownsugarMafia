The wpi_ur5 is the ROS package that we created to enable setting up the ur5 in a specific environment under specific constraints.

The /src folder contains the c++ files required for move group interface(for MoveIt!) and communicating the necessary data between perception and planning - the ROS publisher and subscriber nodes.

/launch folder has the corresponding launch file.
